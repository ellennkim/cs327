### Which is your best space?

Lollipop space

------------

## Space 1


### What kinds of things does this space make?:

Bears

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

bodySize: change size of the bear's face
earSize: change size of bear's ears
noseSize: change size of bear's nose
furColor: change color of bear's face/body
earColor: change color of bear's ears
noseColor: change color of bear's nose
eyeColor: change color of bear's eyes

### What expected kinds of these things are *not* in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

Being able to see the entire bear's body/controlling its size, changing the features of the bear to be either white or black


### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

Completely continuous


### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

I was kind of inspired by cartoon characters (Stitch from Lilo & Stitch, Cheshire Cat from Alice and Wonderland, and Lorax from The Lorax).
Therefore, I took inspiration from these movies/cartoons for the three landmarks (Stitch, Lorax, and Cheshire Bear) and used those color palettes.
For the other 2 landmarks (Napoleon and Despereaux), I thought the Napoleon bear almost resembled a pig because of its bright pink color, so I used Animal Farm as inspiration.
For Despereaux, I thought of the movie with the mouse with very large ears and thought this landmark partially resembled that character.

## Space 2


### What kinds of things does this space make?:

Lollipops

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

puffSize: changes size of lollipop itself (outer ellipses)
puffColor: changes color of lollipop itself
candySize: changes size of lollipop (center piece)
candyColor: changes color of center piece
puffLightness: changes the lightness of the outer ellipses
rainbow: if >= 0.5 and colorChange < 0.5, then it makes the outer ellipses rainbow. otherwise, it doesn't do anything
colorChange: if >= 0.5, changes the color of the outer ellipses (sort of like a gradient)

### What expected kinds of these things are *not* in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

more variety of colors, different patterns on the lollipops (like swirls, stripes, etc.)

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

It has some discontinuities because there are if statements that either change the colors or make the lollipop it rainbow depending on the slider values (greater or equal to 0.5).

### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

Cherry Tootsie: I thought it resembled one of the lollipops I used to eat as a kid, especially due to the reddish/brownish color palette.
Mega Blueberry: It reminded me of Violet from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I feel like this would be a candy that she would eat because of its blueberry color/flavor and its massive size.
Rainbow: Pretty self-explanatory, it reminds me of the giant rainbow swirled lollipops.
Purple Dreams: There's a purple/violet color palette being used, and I feel like it somewhat represents Northwestern in a lollipop.
Watermelon Sorbet: Watermelon is one of my favorite candy flavors, so the green and red colors reminded me of a typical watermelon-flavored candy.

## Space 3


### What kinds of things does this space make?:

Trees

### What are each of the dimensions for this, and what do they control

treeSize: changes size of tree
treeColor: changes color of tree stem and branches
flowerNumber: changes number of petals on each flower
branchNumber: changes number of branches in the tree


### What expected kinds of these things are *not* in this space? (ie, what might someone expect this to generate, but its not part of your system)

Being able to change the shape of the petals, more color customization (changing the color of each petal, meaning there isn't so much of a color pattern throughout the tree)

### Is this space completely continuous, or does it have discontinuities (ie, number of flower petals jumping between integers, or if statements)

It has some discontinuities because there are if statements that either change the lightness of the petals or changes the colors of the petals depending on the slider values (greater than or equal to 0.5).


### What are your landmarks, and why did you pick those?

Grapevines: deep purple color reminded me of wine grapes
Cotton Candy: pastel colors reminded me of cotton candy
Watermelon plant: red and green colors reminded me of a ripe watermelon
Fall: the orange-red colors reminded me of the trees that are out on Sheridan Rd. right now
Cherry Blossoms: light pink petals and darker pink branches reminded me of a cherry blossom tree
