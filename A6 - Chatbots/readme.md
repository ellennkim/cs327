## What Tracery grammar did you make? What does it generate?

I created a list that stores various articles of clothing for my fashion bot, such as types of tops, bottoms, shoes, etc.
As a result, it creates potential outfit suggestions for the user, depending on what they selected.

## What two complexifiers did you use? Describe how you used them, and what effect they have on your bot

1) I used the p5 canvas to draw certain emojis for the emoji bot. You can change/add different emojis to be drawn on the canvas by clicking different buttons.
2) For the emoji bot, I made the bot to have different states, depending on what the user clicks on. It keeps track of these states in the chat and in the canvas.

## Look up the Gricean maxims. Do your bots obey them? Why or why not?

They do not obey all of the maxims.
1) Maxim of quantity - my fashion bot offers a variety of clothing recommendations, but the responses from my emoji bot are not very diverse. Either way, both bots have hard-coded response that are not very nuanced.
2) Maxim of quality - I personally don't think either of my bots present any false information because for my emoji bot, the texts are in response to the user input. I don't think there's anything deceptive about fashion advice.
3) Maxim of relation - Both of my bots don't really use the user texts, so it's hard to "stay on topic" and hold a relevant conversation.
4) Maxim of manner - My emoji bot may lack clarity due to the limited responses. My fashion bot may be overly verbose, but an outfit could truly just be this complex.

## Which bot do you like more?

My fashion bot - it gave me some outfit suggestions that I already wear.

# Bot #1 - Fashion Bot

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

Most of the interaction is limited to just pressing the buttons. You can type anything and send a text, but it will give you the same prompt asking you to pick a specific situation.

## Describe your bot's character

Helpful, contemplative

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

The bot uses timing and "thinking messages" to act as if it's truly thinking. Some of these phrases include "Let's try this..." and "Let me create an outfit for you...".
It also uses Tracery grammar to create random combinations of outfits. I also included suggestion phrases to switch up the wording for each recommendation.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I used the pink theme to present the bot as a feminine, fashion-loving bot. I wanted the scene to be fun and girly while keeping it simple at the same time.
I also used the classic blue and white text message colors to make the website really feel like a conversation with a chatbot.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

If you type something in the chat, it will always just say "Pick a situation that best fits your needs! ʚ♡ɞ", so the expressive range is quite limited.

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

If you press the "Surprise Me" button, the bot will respond with a thinking message and an outfit recommendation. However, this recommendation results with the most unique combination of articles of clothing, using colors, patterns, and types of fabrics.

## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

If you press the "Warm Outfit" button, it will not recommend an entire outfit but rather an article of clothing to add to a previous outfit recommendation to keep you warm.

# Bot #2 - Emoji Bot

## What should the user know about interacting with this bot (turn on sound, keywords to use, etc)

You cannot send texts; you can only interact with the buttons at the bottom. Each emoji button will result in the bot "texting" a corresponding message, and it will add that emoji and all the previous emojis to the canvas.

## Describe your bot's character

Not very talkative, but it draws a lot

## How does your bot listen, think, and speak?

It relies on the buttons to spit out a brief text blurb and to draw these emojis on the canvas.

## How have your styled your page to best present this character? What scene or mood are you suggesting?

I used the classic blue and white text message colors to make the website really feel like a conversation with a chatbot like I did with my other bot.
I also used pastel colors to make the place feel welcoming and cozy.

## Describe the first thing this bot can respond to.  What is the expressive range of what you say in response?

If you press the smiley face emoji, it will say "Today is a good day!~~", and it will start drawing that emoji and a sun emoji.
The range is very limited because you cannot respond at all, but you can change the emoji state.

## Describe the second thing this bot can respond to

If you click the heart button, it will say "Feeling so much love today.", and it will start drawing the 2 heart emojis as well as all the previous emoji combinations.


## Describe the third thing this bot can respond to

If you click the sparkle emoji button, it will say "Hope you have a magical day today!", and similarly, it will start drawing the sparkle emoji and a starstruck face emoji along with all the previous emojis.
