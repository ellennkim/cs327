Created a mosiac, self-portrait, pacman, caterpillars, moving dots using polar curves, and some shapes moving
I used p5 and chatGPT (explained below)

## What P5 method or technique did you enjoy using the most? What was interesting to you about it?

I liked being able to change the hues based on the time within the loop because it added a lot of variety.

## Did you find any P5 functionality that wasn't covered in class?

Arcs

## How did you get your looping gif to loop smoothly? What was hard or easy about that techinque?

It was hard, but I used loop length to get the loop to reset smoothly.

### Does the self-portrait "look like you"? What is missing? What worked well?

Yes; missing some details with the clothes, but I'd say it sorta looks like me.
