### Which was your favorite mask that you made, and why?

The underwater mask - it's simple, but I like the design of it more than the cat mask. It was also the 2nd mask I made, so I think once I started to get the hang of things (working with contours and face landmarks), I better understood how to draw out the facial features and the bubbles.

# Mask 1

### Describe this mask

Cat Mask - I was inspired by the Japanese cat masks where the mask has a solid color and then a different color for details (swirls, curves, etc.). Some of the masks also have tassels on each ear, so I tried to replicate that as well.
The starting colors for this mask kind of remind me of the Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, but the user can customize the colors.

###  What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

1) Cat ear height - you can control how long/tall the cat ears are. The user may want to adjust this to change the size of the mask;
because I used the horns mechanism from the starter code, changing the ear height also changes the ear width. This means the mask size may also be adjusted to give the mask a different feel, such as a rabbit mask.

2) Cat mask color - I started with a pinkish-purple color palette because it resembles the Chesire Cat, but the user may want to adjust this to better personalize the mask to their liking.

3) Cat details color - I went for a similar color to the cat mask color, but the user may want to change this so that the colors are not similar at all. In fact, a lot of Japanese cat masks have a white base and bright color details. This control was similarly added for customization purposes.
### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

For the hands, I used the finger contours to create "claw-like" fingers to further contribute to the overarching cat theme. I used a simple gray-blue background color for the canvas.
I wanted the main focus of the mask to be the actual mask, so I didn't want the background to be distracting.

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The tassel earrings rely on secondary motion because it follows the movement of the mask. The tracking data affects this motion because there are specific forces that are used to control the movement, such as wander forces. Despite the forces used, the earrings follow the face around.

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

A costume/mask would best describe this mask because the person "wearing" this mask may be dressed up as a cat in a cat costume.

# Mask 2

### Describe this mask

Underwater mask - I wanted to create a mask that looks like you're under the sea, which is why I implemented the bubbles and the goggles.

###  What three additional controls did you add? Why would the user want to adjust that?

1) Goggles outer/inner color - for color customization purposes to better personalize the mask for the user

2) Skin color - again, for user personalization purposes

3) Bubble speed - the user might want to speed up the bubbles if the current bubble speed is too slow for them

### What did you do for the hands and the environment? Why is that the right choice for this mask?

I kept the hands the same color as the customized skin color because I want the user to feel like they're truly under water.
For the background, I kept it simple with a blue color to reinforce the underwater theme.

### What secondary motion does this mask have? How does the tracking data affect this motion?

The bubbles use secondary motion because it follows around the position of the mouth on the mask. The tracking data affects this motion because it relies on the movement and orientation of the mask when the bubbles initially spawn.

### Of the ontology in class (mirror, mask, puppet, costume, environment, dance partner) which one(s) best describe this mask and why?

Mask/environment best describe this mask because the user is wearing the mask, which feels like you're underwater and in a different environment.
